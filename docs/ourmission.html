<h1><strong>Our mission</strong></h1>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div align="justify">
<p>Our mission is to promote equity and justice for all people in the
academy. The academy privileges particular identities based on gender,
race, class and ability, to name a few. We see that there is a long way
to go in improving the research, teaching, and working conditions for
systemically underprivileged groups in academic institutions. We believe
that changes are on the way and are excited to be part of these changes.
Our work currently revolves around academic publications and conference
presentations, but we are looking for diverse strategies to expand into
teaching, consulting, and more practice-oriented activities. This
journey begins with ourselves, and thus one of the main missions of this
group has been to learn from each other’s diverse views and experiences,
and become better academics and feminists.</p>
</div>

<div id="feminist-wonder-lab-code-of-conduct" class="section level1"

<h1><strong>Feminist Wonder Lab Code of Conduct</strong></h1>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div align="justify">
<div id="diversity-statement" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Diversity Statement</strong></h2>
<p>We are a voluntary-based international educational and research
community that aims to create, develop and foster feminist practices in
science. We are open, inclusive and diverse, and we function and abide
by the principle of open, reproducible and transparent scholarship. We
welcome new members from any background, as long as they support our
principles, but we particularly strive to amplify underrepresented
voices in science and research.  </p>
</div>
<div id="pledge-and-aims-of-this-document" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Pledge and Aims of This Document</strong></h2>
<p>This code of conduct outlines the founding principles of the Feminist
Wonder Lab. It is established to serve as a behaviour and attitude
guideline, applicable throughout each and every of Feminist Wonder Lab’s
projects and interactions, thus all members should abide by it. Every
member should be aware of the rules and principles in this code of
conduct, in order to be able to follow them.  </p>
</div>
<div id="rules" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Rules</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be respectful and patient:</strong> We welcome group members
from all backgrounds and identities, with different lived experiences
and communication styles. This means we might not always agree with each
other. Try to negotiate the common grounds and seek mutual understanding
in the interaction with other members. Give other people chances to
share opinions and take part in activities and tasks. People are diverse
and that makes our community stronger and more knowledgeable, so try to
keep an open mind and learn from each other.</li>
<li><strong>Be responsible and communicate openly:</strong> The work we
do requires team efforts and coordination. Team members might often need
to work simultaneously or asynchronously on the same task, so that the
team’s overall work can advance. This means that every team member needs
to act responsibly in completing their part of the work and communicate
openly to others their availability, willingness, expertise, experience
and suggestions for the task and the project. We recognize all
contributions, in whatever form they may be, transparently.</li>
<li><strong>Be generous in sharing helpful knowledge and aim to benefit
the community:</strong> Be generous when requested to share knowledge or
task-related information to other team members. The Feminist Wonder Lab
was created to learn and teach each other how to be better researchers,
academics and educators, and lift each other up. Try to learn and guide
others in the learning process. You should feel and act as part of a
team of like-minded people: share helpful project-related information
with others, and make sure you take decisions together, as a team. The
interests of the community should be prioritised above any personal
gains or interests. We are in this together!</li>
<li><strong>Use preferred pronouns (e.g. she/her/hers,
they/their/theirs, he/him/his) and preferred (nick)names to address
people.</strong> If you’re not sure which one to use, ask the person. If
possible, show your pronouns visibly (e.g. in your Zoom name) to make it
easy for people to address you correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Follow the standards of open, transparent and reproducible
scholarship practices:</strong> The Feminist Wonder Lab is built around
the idea of open and transparent scholarship, and stands firmly behind
research integrity and ethics principles. We strongly advise any member
to acquaint themselves with a reputable and reliable research integrity
document, and we would like to particularly recommend:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/#toggle-id-17" target="_blank">The
European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.who.int/about/ethics/code-of-conduct-for-responsible-research" target="_blank">World
Health Organization’s Code of Conduct for responsible research</a><br />
</li>

<p style="margin-left: -40px;">
As a further knowledge resource into open, reproducible and transparent
scholarship, we also recommend
<a href="https://forrt.org/syllabus/" target="_blank">FORRT’s Open and
Reproducible Science Syllabus</a>. The standards of open, transparent
and reproducible scholarship practices include both practising active
behaviours of good research integrity, as well as avoiding passive acts
of omissions of such integrity. Good research practice acts include:
</p></li>
<li>Honesty in proposing, conducting and reporting research.</li>
<li>Honesty in reporting and acknowledging contributions, as well as
granting authorship to researchers who have made significant
intellectual, scholarly, or practical contributions to that output and
are willing to take responsibility for the contribution.</li>
<li>Compliance with ethical and legal obligations as required by
statutory and regulatory authorities.</li>
<li>Ensuring the safety, dignity, wellbeing and rights of those
associated with the research.</li>
<li>Reporting transparently and managing timely any conflicts of
interest.</li>
<li>Recognising one’s responsibility and accountability to the Feminist
Wonder Lab community for their research conduct.<br>
<p style="margin-left: -40px;">
Omissions include:
</p></li>
<li>Falsification or fabrication of data, including intentionally or by
mistake.</li>
<li>Misrepresentation of data, including the invention of data and the
omission from analysis and publication of inconvenient data.</li>
<li>Failure to follow good practice for the proper preservation,
management and sharing of primary data, artefacts and material.</li>
<li>Unacknowledged appropriation of the work of others, including
plagiarism, the abuse of confidentiality with respect to unpublished
materials, or misappropriation of results, physical materials or other
resources.</li>
<li>Misrepresentation of involvement in a research project; for example,
the failure to include legitimate author(s) on outputs, or granting
authorship where none is warranted, or of credentials, including
qualifications, experience, and publication history.</li>
<li>Failure to declare conflicts of interest.</li>
<li>Failure to follow accepted procedures, legal, professional or
ethical requirements, or to exercise due care in carrying out
responsibilities for avoiding unreasonable harm or risk to humans, other
vertebrates, cephalopods or the environment.</li>
<li>Failure to follow existing guidance on good practice in research,
including proper handling of privileged, private or confidential
information collected on individuals during the research.</li>
<li>Improper conduct in peer review of research proposals, results or
manuscripts submitted for publication.</li>
<li>Improper dealing with allegations of misconduct: failing to address
possible infringements, or to adhere to agreed procedures in the
investigation of alleged research misconduct accepted as a condition of
funding.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Failure to comply with these rules may give rise to an allegation of
Code of Conduct Violation which may be a ground for, if serious, for
dismissal from our Feminist Wonder Lab community and projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acquaint yourself well with the list of unacceptable
behaviours.</strong> Should you happen to witness any of the below
behaviours, please report it following the misconduct reporting
procedures in this document. We do not allow any of the following
unacceptable behaviours in our Feminist Wonder Lab community:
<ul>
<li>Intimidating, harassing, lewd, demeaning, bullying, stalking, or
threatening speech or actions.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind.</li>
<li>Unwelcome physical contact.</li>
<li>Any real or implied threat of physical harm.</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of speakers or events (verbally or
physically).</li>
<li>Violent behaviours, threats or language directed against another
person.</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks or
insults.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>The use of ableist, sexualized, sexist, racist, xenophobic or
violent language or imagery.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally
identifying information (“doxing”).</li>
<li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
stop, then stop.</li>
<li>Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or other
unacceptable behaviours or for participating in an investigation of such
a claim.</li>
<li>Passing judgement about personal choices or forcing disclosure of
one’s own experiences and identifications.</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
a professional setting.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviours.  </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="enforcement-responsibilities" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Enforcement Responsibilities</strong></h2>
<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our
standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. You can find the
current community leaders on our <a href="index.html">Who we are</a>
page.  </p>
</div>
<div id="scope" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Scope</strong></h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, physical
and virtual, and also applies when an individual is officially
representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing
our community include using an official email address, posting via an
official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative
at an online or offline event.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviours:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Participants who are asked to stop any unacceptable behaviour are
expected to comply immediately.</li>
<li>Potential consequences for violations of this code of conduct
include, but are not limited to: warning the offender, dismissal from
the Slack Community and Feminist Wonder Lab events, banning from future
events, and denying or revoking the community membership.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Reporting:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any
other concerns, please report it as indicated below. All complaints will
be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders
are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any
incident. All reports will be handled with discretion.</li>
<li>You can report a suspected code of conduct violation to any member
of Feminist Wonder Lab’s community, including your names (real,
nicknames, or pseudonyms) and those of any individuals involved. If
there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Please
include your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident
is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list
archive), please include a link, as well as any additional information
that may be helpful for the case.</li>
<li>After filing a report, a community member that is not involved in
your case personally and does not have any conflict of interest will
contact you, review the incident, follow up with any additional
questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. We will respect
confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
