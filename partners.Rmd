In a nutshell, FORRT is a Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training which is advancing research transparency, reproducibility, rigor, and ethics through pedagogical reform and meta-scientific research. FORRT provides a pedagogical infrastructure and open educational resources designed to support the teaching and mentoring of open and reproducible science. FORRT strives to (a) raise awareness of the pedagogical implications of open and reproducible science and its associated challenges (i.e., curricular reform, epistemological uncertainty, methods of education); (b) respond to calls to consider open scholarship as inclusive scholarship; (c) advocate for the opening and formal recognition of teaching and mentoring materials to facilitate access, discovery, and learning to those who otherwise would be educationally disenfranchised.

ABRIR (Advancing Big-team Reproducible Science through Increased Representation) began as an initiative to identify the unique challenges faced by social science researchers from developing countries. Their long-term mission is to continue the work of identifying challenges uniquely faced by researchers from the Global South and devising best practices that can be shared within the academic community. They hope to build a collaborative network of psychological science researchers from low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) to explore and answer questions of deep relevance to their local regions.
